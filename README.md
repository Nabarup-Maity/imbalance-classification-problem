# Background:
At 48 billion, India accounts for largest number of real-time transactions in the world in 2021 according to ACI a real-time payments infrastructure firm, ~3x that of nearest challenger China and 6.5x times greater than the US, Canada, UK, France & Germany combined. Covid-induced movement to real-time money movement ecosystem has improved customer experience but at the same time has opened doors for fraudsters to siphon-off money from bank accounts through innovative methods.
Balancing enhanced CX with safety requires financial institutions to invest in Machine Learning capabilities to detect frauds on a real-time basis. In addition to the vast amount of on-us data about customers, the banks are leveraging consortium solutions to augment their capabilities and producing algorithms to be a step ahead of the fraudsters. 


# Problem Description:
You are working as a data scientist with the Payments team of the bank. The team is continually responding to the emerging threats by building up cutting-edge machine learning driven models and strategies, working with the best-in-class service providers specialized in counter-fraud solutions. In recent years, there has been an increased scrutiny of the digital payments to check for its genuineness.
To aid the team to deal with this problem, you are provided with the payments data to predict whether the customer themselves have made the transfer or not. The payments data contains the attributes which gets captures when a payment is initiated by a banking customer.


# Task:
You are required to build a machine learning model that can predict whether the customer themselves have made the transfer or not.


Kindly refer to the approach file and notebook for understanding in details.
